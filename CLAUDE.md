# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal web development starter project consisting of basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The project uses vanilla web technologies without any build tools, frameworks, or package managers.

## File Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file (currently empty)
- `script.js` - JavaScript file (currently empty) 
- `styles.css` - CSS stylesheet (currently empty)
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `LICENSE` - MIT license

## Development Commands

Since this is a vanilla web project without build tools:

- Open `index.html` directly in a browser for testing
- Use a local development server for better development experience:
  - Python: `python -m http.server 8000` or `python3 -m http.server 8000`
  - Node.js: `npx serve .` (if Node.js is available)
  - VS Code: Use Live Server extension

## Architecture

This is a client-side only web application using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No server-side components, build processes, or package management are configured.
